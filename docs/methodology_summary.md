# Methodology Summary

This document gives a high-level overview of how the **PromptSpec Pattern Catalog** was constructed. It covers only the catalog published in this artifact; the broader PromptSpec model and its evaluation are described in the associated publication.

## Pattern Identification

Patterns were identified through literature review. They were not empirically observed in a prompt corpus, and this public artifact does not claim corpus-level frequency or occurrence evidence.

### Literature Review
A review of prompt-engineering literature was conducted to identify established patterns. Sources include:

## Taxonomy Construction

The 29 patterns were organized into a two-level taxonomy:
- **Category**: 5 high-level groups (In-Context Learning, Reasoning, Output Control, Context Control, Meta Directives)
- **Subcategory**: Finer-grained classification within each category

## Limitations

- Pattern frequency statistics are not included in this public artifact.
- Pattern definitions are literature-derived and should not be interpreted as empirically observed corpus annotations.
- This artifact publishes the pattern catalog only; structural composition and the queryable graph are covered in the publication.
