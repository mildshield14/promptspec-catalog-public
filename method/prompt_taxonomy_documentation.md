# Prompt Pattern Taxonomy — Full Reproducibility Documentation

This document records, in full, the methodology and raw data behind the 29-pattern "writable prompt" taxonomy. Everything here is generated directly from the underlying dataset (`master_raw_dataset.csv`), so the counts below are exact, not estimates.

## 1. Source papers

Five papers were read in full and mined for every named prompting technique/pattern presented in each paper's own technique catalog or taxonomy section:

| # | Paper | arXiv ID | What was extracted |

| 1 | White, Fu, Hays, Sandborn, Olea, Gilbert, Elnashar, Spencer-Smith & Schmidt (2023). *A Prompt Pattern Catalog to Enhance Prompt Engineering with ChatGPT* | 2302.11382 | All 16 patterns in Section III ("A Catalog of Prompt Patterns for Conversational LLMs"), Table I. |
| 2 | Schulhoff et al. (2024, v6). *The Prompt Report: A Systematic Survey of Prompting Techniques* | 2406.06608 | All techniques in Section 2.2 ("Text-Based Techniques"), Figure 2.2: In-Context Learning, Thought Generation, Decomposition, Ensembling, Self-Criticism. |

## 2. Methodology — four stages

### Stage 1 — PASS 1: Raw extraction
Every distinctly named technique presented in each paper's own technique-catalog section was logged as one row, with: the exact name used in that paper, the section/subsection it appeared in, a one-line concept summary written by re-reading the paper's own description (not copied verbatim — paraphrased for this catalog), and a normalized name string.

**Result: 176 raw rows.**

| Source paper | Raw techniques extracted |
|---|---|
| Schulhoff et al. 2024 (The Prompt Report) | 55 |
| Sahoo et al. 2024 | 41 |
| Vatsal & Dubey 2024 | 39 |
| Fagbohun et al. 2024 | 25 |
| White et al. 2023 | 16 |

### Stage 2 — PASS 2: Exact name + concept dedup
Rows whose normalized name is identical were grouped into one entry, on the assumption (verified by re-reading) that when two papers use the literal same technique name, they are describing the same technique. For e.g. "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting" appears under that near-identical name in Schulhoff, Sahoo, Vatsal & Dubey and Fagbohun down to a single entry, while keeping differently-named techniques (even if conceptually related) as separate entries pending Pass 3.

**Result: 163 unique (name, concept) groups** (down from 176 raw mentions — 13 raw mentions were exact-name duplicates of another paper's entry).

### Stage 3 — PASS 3: Concept-only dedup (synonym merge)
Pass-2 groups were then read again and merged wherever two *differently-named* entries clearly describe the *same underlying technique* — i.e. same fundamental contextual statements/structure, just labelled differently by different authors. Examples of synonym merges performed:

| Concept A | Concept B | Why merged |
|---|---|---|
| Persona (White 2023) | Role Prompting (Schulhoff 2024) | Schulhoff's own text states Role Prompting is "also known as persona prompting" — explicit author-acknowledged synonym. |
| Persona (White 2023) | Multi-Personas Prompting (Fagbohun 2024) | Same core mechanism (assign the LLM a named role/character); Fagbohun's variant emphasizes switching between multiple personas across turns, which is a usage variant, not a different structural pattern. |
| Reflection (White 2023) | Self-reflection Prompting (Fagbohun 2024) | Both ask the LLM to evaluate/explain its own prior answer in a single follow-up instruction. |
| Reversing Chain-of-Thought / RCoT (Schulhoff 2024) | → "Reverse CoT" final pattern | Simplified to the single-prompt "state the answer first, then justify it" framing that also matches the example wording used in the final taxonomy. |
| Self-Verification (Schulhoff 2024) | → "SelfVerification" final pattern | Multi-candidate masked-prediction scoring (Weng et al. 2022's original technique) simplified to a single-prompt generate-then-verify instruction for the catalog. |
| Self-Calibration (Schulhoff 2024) | → "SelfCalibration" final pattern | Two-prompt confidence-check pipeline (Kadavath et al. 2022's original technique) simplified to a single-prompt multi-path-and-confidence instruction for the catalog. |
| Complexity-Based Prompting (Schulhoff 2024) | Complex CoT (Vatsal & Dubey 2024 / Sahoo 2024) | Both select/weight reasoning by complexity and majority-vote over the most complex chains — same underlying idea, Vatsal & Dubey's naming ("Complex CoT") was kept as canonical for the final sheet. |
| Basic/Standard/Vanilla Prompting (Vatsal & Dubey 2024) | Zero-Shot Prompting | In this literature "basic prompting" (direct query, no scaffolding) and "zero-shot prompting" (no exemplars) are used near-interchangeably as the no-engineering baseline; merged for the catalog. |

**Result: 128 unique underlying concepts/techniques** (down from 163 Pass-2 groups — 35 were synonym merges across differently-named entries). This 128 is the count of genuinely distinct prompting techniques described anywhere across all 5 papers, after full deduplication.

### Stage 4 — Final filter: writable single-prompt patterns only
Each of the 128 unique concepts was then classified into exactly one of three buckets:

- **INCLUDED** (29) — the technique can be written as a single, self-contained instruction block inside one prompt turn, the way White et al.'s Persona pattern works ("Act as X, provide outputs that X would create"). No external tool calls, no multiple LLM invocations, no iterative loop, no training/offline step required to use it.
- **EXCLUDED_WORKFLOW** (68) — the technique inherently requires multiple LLM calls, an external tool/interpreter/retrieval system, an iterative critique-revise loop, an agentic action loop, an ensembling/voting scheme over multiple samples, or an offline/training-time procedure (e.g. APE, OPRO, Active-Prompting's human-annotation loop, ReAct, RAG, Tree-of-Thought's search, Self-Consistency's majority vote, etc.). These are orchestration/pipeline techniques, not single writable prompts.
- **EXCLUDED_OUT_OF_SCOPE** (31) — technically a single-prompt technique, but not selected for the final 29-pattern catalog because it is (a) a narrow task-specific variant not meant to generalize (e.g. "Basic with Term Definitions", a medical-domain experiment that the source paper itself found ineffective), (b) a modality-specific extension out of scope for a text-prompt-pattern catalog (e.g. Multimodal Prompting), (c) a design heuristic rather than a discrete prompt pattern (e.g. Exemplar Ordering), or (d) conceptually adjacent to an already-included pattern but not independently corroborated by name+concept across the source papers, and so not selected as a separate catalog entry (e.g. Socratic Prompting, Contrastive Prompting, Grammar Correction, Constrained Vocabulary Prompting).

**Final result: 29 writable single-prompt patterns.**
